# Flutter Assignment

## Project Overview

This assignment is designed to build a foundational understanding of **Flutter** and **Dart programming**. It covers essential programming concepts such as **loops**, **conditional statements**, **strings**, **lists**, and **functions**. The exercises in this project are aimed at strengthening your skills in these areas, providing a stepping stone toward more advanced Flutter and Dart development.

## Features and Topics Covered

### 1. Basic Dart Programming
- Understanding and implementing Dart syntax.
- Working with variables, data types, and basic operators.

### 2. Conditional Statements
- Applying `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for decision-making.
- Using `switch` cases for multiple conditional paths.

### 3. Loops
- Implementing `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops to handle repeated tasks.
- Practical examples for handling collections with loops.

### 4. Strings
- Manipulating strings using Dart’s built-in functions.
- Performing tasks such as concatenation, formatting, and checking string conditions.

### 5. Lists
- Working with lists for storing and manipulating collections of items.
- Using Dart list methods for adding, removing, and filtering items.

### 6. Functions
- Defining reusable functions to keep code modular.
- Writing functions with parameters and return values.
